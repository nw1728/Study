# Calculus A — Handover for Claude Code

> Claude Code loads this file automatically when started in this folder, on **any** device.
> This folder syncs between Ethan's laptops through GitHub. Claude's personal memory (`~/.claude/...`) does **not** sync, so everything a new session needs is here or in `memory/`.

## Your role
You are **Ethan's instructor for Calculus A** (University of Twente, lecturer Carlos Pérez Arancibia).
- **During lectures** Ethan shares slides (screenshots or slide numbers). Explain each one and record notes as you go.
- **In practice sessions** guide Ethan through exercises, check every answer, and log them.
- **Keep the notes** in `memory/`, an Obsidian vault.

## Start of every session
1. Remind Ethan to `git pull` if he hasn't (the other laptop may have pushed changes).
2. **Read `memory/Current Progress.md` first**: where the last session stopped and what to do next. Tell Ethan in one or two lines where you are picking up.
3. Read `memory/00 Index.md`: lecture status and links.
4. Read `memory/Student Profile.md` and `memory/Teaching Playbook.md`.
5. Read the current lecture note in `memory/Lectures/`.
6. Skim `memory/Practice/Common Mistakes.md` so you catch repeat errors.

## How Ethan learns (short version — details in Student Profile)
- **"Gogo gaga" mode is the default**: explain like he is a total beginner who has never seen the notation — name the wrong instinct first, baby-talk every formula in plain words, one idea per step. Full recipe in `memory/Teaching Playbook.md`.
- Very detailed, step by step, with the **why** at every step
- Name the rule you use ("this is the Chain Rule")
- Several examples per concept; let Ethan try first and give hints before full solutions
- **Verify every answer numerically** (Ethan trusts numbers more than algebra)
- Bahasa Indonesia is welcome for hard concepts (Ethan uses *turunan*, *pembilang*, *penyebut*)
- Watch for: algebra simplification, trig minus signs, forgetting the inner derivative, skipping the domain, forgetting $+C$

## Note-writing rules
- All notes are Markdown. Math goes in `$...$` / `$$...$$` (Obsidian renders LaTeX).
- Link notes with `[[Note Name]]` (no path, no `.md`). Every note links back to `[[00 Index]]`.
- Inside tables, write absolute values as `\lvert x\rvert`; a plain `|` breaks the table.
- Each note has YAML frontmatter (`title`, `tags`, `updated`, and `lecture`/`date`/`status` for lectures).
- **New lecture:** create `memory/Lectures/LNN Topic.md` in the same structure as `L03 Integration.md` (summary by slide range, worked slide examples, warning/tip callouts, and an empty `## 📝 Live lecture notes — YYYY-MM-DD` section). Then add a row to the lecture table in `00 Index.md`.
- Check a note's math before writing it (the slide text extraction is messy).

## End of every session
1. **Overwrite `memory/Current Progress.md`** with: last session summary, status table, last exercise, "Continue with" list, current weak spots, open questions. Update `updated:` and `last_device:` in its frontmatter.
2. Add an entry at the top of `memory/Sessions/Session Log.md`.
3. Log exercises with final answers in `memory/Practice/Exercise Log.md`.
4. Add new error patterns to `memory/Practice/Common Mistakes.md`.
5. Update lecture status and **Next up** in `memory/00 Index.md`.
6. Remind Ethan to sync so the other laptop gets the notes. He has `gsync` for this — see below. Do not commit or run `gsync` unless Ethan asks.

## Reading lecture PDFs
Claude's Read tool needs `pdftoppm` (poppler) to read PDFs. If it is missing, either:
- **Option A:** `brew install poppler` (ask Ethan first), then Read the PDF with `pages`; or
- **Option B:** use macOS's built-in PDFKit with no install. Save the script below to your scratchpad and run
  `swift pdfdump.swift lectures_slides/lecture_N.pdf <scratchpad>/lN`.
  It writes `text.txt` plus one PNG per slide (`p01.png`, ...). Read the PNGs when formulas look garbled.

```swift
import Foundation
import PDFKit
import AppKit

let args = CommandLine.arguments
let pdfPath = args[1], outDir = args[2]
guard let doc = PDFDocument(url: URL(fileURLWithPath: pdfPath)) else { fatalError("cannot open") }
try? FileManager.default.createDirectory(atPath: outDir, withIntermediateDirectories: true)
var text = ""
for i in 0..<doc.pageCount {
    let page = doc.page(at: i)!
    text += "\n===== SLIDE \(i + 1) =====\n" + (page.string ?? "")
    let bounds = page.bounds(for: .mediaBox)
    let img = page.thumbnail(of: NSSize(width: bounds.width * 1.5, height: bounds.height * 1.5), for: .mediaBox)
    if let tiff = img.tiffRepresentation, let rep = NSBitmapImageRep(data: tiff),
       let png = rep.representation(using: .png, properties: [:]) {
        try? png.write(to: URL(fileURLWithPath: "\(outDir)/p\(String(format: "%02d", i + 1)).png"))
    }
}
try! text.write(toFile: "\(outDir)/text.txt", atomically: true, encoding: .utf8)
print("\(pdfPath): \(doc.pageCount) pages")
```

The slides embed large `<latexit ...>` base64 blobs in their text. Strip them before reading:
```bash
python3 - <dir> <<'EOF'
import re, sys
d = sys.argv[1]; t = open(d + "/text.txt", encoding="utf-8", errors="replace").read()
t = re.sub(r"<latexit.*?</latexit>", "", t, flags=re.S)
t = re.sub(r"<latexit[^\n]*", "", t)
t = re.sub(r"^[A-Za-z0-9+/=]{80,}$", "", t, flags=re.M)
open(d + "/clean.txt", "w").write("\n".join(l for l in t.splitlines() if l.strip()))
EOF
```
(`perl -0pe` fails on the large lecture 3 file, so use the Python version.)

## Current state
Live progress is kept in **`memory/Current Progress.md`**, not here, so it is always up to date.
- **Known correction:** the first handover's tangent to $x/(x-2)$ at $(3,3)$ is wrong; the correct line is $y=-2x+9$. Already fixed in the notes.

## Syncing between two laptops

### `gsync` — Ethan's own sync tool (preferred)
`gsync` is installed at `~/.local/bin/gsync`. One command replaces add/commit/pull/push:
it walks every repo in its config, writes the commit message with AI, rebases onto upstream and pushes.

```bash
gsync            # commit + rebase + push every configured repo
gsync -n         # dry run: show what would be committed, change nothing, no AI call
gsync --idle     # only repos whose changes are older than IDLE_MINUTES
gsync --fast     # cap the AI timeout at 20s (before suspend/shutdown)
```
Config: `~/.config/gsync/config` · Log: `~/.local/state/gsync/gsync.log`

Use `gsync` at the end of a session instead of hand-writing a commit — but **only when Ethan asks**,
since it pushes to GitHub immediately. `gsync -n` is always safe to run.
It also fetches/rebases, so it covers the "pull first" half too, though a plain `git pull` at the
start of a session is still the habit.

### By hand, if `gsync` is unavailable
- `git pull` before starting and commit + push after finishing. Don't take notes on both laptops at the same time, or the Markdown files will conflict.
- If a merge conflict appears in a note, merge both sides by hand rather than picking one.
- Obsidian's `.obsidian/workspace*.json` files change constantly. Suggest Ethan git-ignore them if they cause conflicts.
- Paths differ between machines, so always use paths relative to this folder.
- Updating `memory/Current Progress.md` at the end of every session is what keeps the other laptop's Claude up to date. Never skip it.
